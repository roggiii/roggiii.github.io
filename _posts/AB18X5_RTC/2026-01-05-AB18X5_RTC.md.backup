specifically AB1815

### Goals:

\- as low as possible power consumption  
\- disconnect MCU when not in use, not only wake up over interrupt  
\- high clock accuracy not needed, should be able to wake up MCU every 30 seconds, can diviate a few percent  
\- save data from MCU to internal RTC RAM 





The [Datasheet](https://abracon.com/Support/AppsManuals/Precisiontiming/AB18XX-Application-Manual.pdf) is best downloaded directly from the manufacturer Abracon, because the usual sources like Mouser/Digikey only provide a abbreviated version.

It comes in a 16 pin QFN package, which is only 3x3mm in size. Soldering with a hot air gun should be possible.
