title: AB18X5 Real Time Clock
---
specifically AB1815

### Goals:

\- as low as possible power consumption  
\- disconnect MCU when not in use, not only wake up over interrupt  
\- high clock accuracy not needed, should be able to wake up MCU every 30 seconds, can diviate a few percent  
\- save data from MCU to internal RTC RAM
