specifically AB1815

# Goals:

\- as low as possible power consumption  
\- disconnect MCU when not in use, not only wake up over interrupt  
\- high clock accuracy not needed, should be able to wake up MCU every 30 seconds, can diviate a few percent  
\- save data from MCU to internal RTC RAM 


# Footprint


The [Datasheet](https://abracon.com/Support/AppsManuals/Precisiontiming/AB18XX-Application-Manual.pdf) is best downloaded directly from the manufacturer Abracon, because the usual sources like Mouser/Digikey only provide a abbreviated version.

It comes in a 16 pin QFN package, which is only 3x3mm in size. Soldering with a hot air gun should be possible. The thermal pad on the bottom side needs to be connected to ground.

All footprints I found online were no match and the closest standart library part *QFN-16-1EP_3x3mm_P0.5mm_EP1.7x1.7mm* was also not ideal. Guess I'm making my own. Since I find it quite tidious to draw footprints in KiCad, I usally do it in Fusion 360 and then export a .dfx file.
