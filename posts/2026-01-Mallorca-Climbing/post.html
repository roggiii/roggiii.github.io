<h1 class="title">Climbing in Mallorca</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I've now spent two fall seasons in Mallorca climbing and wanted to quickly talk about my experiences and what to watch out for. 
</p>
    

    
<h2>Season</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I really like to combine deep water soloing (DWS) with some normal climbing. For this reason we always went from the middle of September to middle of Oktober. In September it is still hot enough to enjoy falling in the ocean repeatetly since the temperature was always around 26°C. When it dips to 23°C in Oktober it gets chilly really fast by the ocean, since around this time of year strong winds start picking up which last the whole winter. For these reasons I find it best to enjoy climbing over the water in September and go sport climbing in Oktober.

<h2>Climbing Spots</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Cala Santani: Really nice and easy DWS spot to get started and you have to take a look at <em>Es pontas</em>. It is quite easy to climb up on sides and jump down and there is an awesome rope swing in the middle. You also have to watch Chris Sharmas video bevorhand.
</p>
    
<h2>Climbing Tipps</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
DWS: Take a plastic bag with you and put your chalkbag inside; Take a small kitchen towel with you as well; Use "Surf Ears" if you have problems with staying longer in ocean water. Liquid chalk is really nice.
</p> 
    
    
<h2>Getting around</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    Small cars are better, if you are a bigger group take two cars. It is really cramped and parking is always at a premium, even at climbing crags
    
    Take the first week in the north and the second week in the south, the island is not really big, but you get to see a lot more of it that way

<h2>Things to avoid</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Avoid the city of <em>Cala Llombards</em> if you would like to go out in cafés or restaurants. There are only holiday houses and vacation rentals and not really people living there. It feels really dead, since there are no local ammenitys besides one small shop. The prices on AirBnB or Booking.com may seem tempting, but it's not worth it. Judging by the amount of german licence plates I have seen it's really just a vacation town
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
If you think of staying in this area go to <em>Cala Santani</em>. It is right beside Llombards and is a lot livelier and has a few DWS spots.
