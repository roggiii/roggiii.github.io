<h1 class="title">Climbing in Mallorca</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I've now spent two fall seasons in Mallorca climbing and wanted to talk about my experiences and what to watch out for.
</p>

<h2>Season</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I really like to combine deep water soloing (DWS) with some normal climbing. For this reason we always went from the middle of September to middle of Oktober. In September it is still hot enough to enjoy falling in the ocean repeatetly since the temperature was always around 26°C. When it dips to 23°C in Oktober it gets chilly really fast by the ocean, since around this time of year strong winds start picking up which last the whole winter. For these reasons I find it best to enjoy climbing over the water in September and go sport climbing in Oktober.

<h2>Climbing Spots</h2>
<h3>Cala Santani:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
 Really nice and easy DWS spot to get started, but dont go to the main beach! Instad go to the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=39.328681&mlon=3.147800#map=19/39.328681/3.147800">cliffs</a> right across the first climbing spot. When you are is the city you also have to take a look at <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Es_Pont%C3%A0s">es pontas</a>. Don't be intimidated by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cM8gO4IDN_s">Chris Sharmas first ascend</a>. It is quite easy to climb up on sides and jump down. There is also an awesome rope swing in between of the arches.
</p>
    
<h2>Climbing Tipps</h2> 
<ul>
    <li>Put your chalkbag and a small towel in a plastic bag and deposit it right under the climb</li>
    <li>Use earplugs like <a href="https://surfears.com/de/">Surf Ears</a> if your ears have problems with longer water exposure. Also prevents an ear drum rupture when splashing down uncontrolled.</li>
    <li>Liquid chalk is really nice.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting around</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Small cars are better, if you are a bigger group take multiple cars. The island is really cramped and parking is always at a premium, even at climbing crags.</li>
    <li>What I found really nice is to not stay in one house, but to first stay in the south and then move to a second house in the north.</li>
    <li>When going deep water soloing it can be tricky to find the location, since not every climb is is a bay where it is easily visible from the other side. Here I found <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org">Open Street Map</a> really nice, since most crags are visible on the map. I used the app <a href="https://osmand.net/de/">OsmAnd</a> and set the point-of-interest (POI) to <em>climbing</em>.</li>
</ul>
    
<h2>Things to avoid</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Avoid the city of <em>Cala Llombards</em> if you would like to go out in cafés or restaurants. There are only holiday houses and vacation rentals and not really people living there. It feels really dead, since there are no local ammenitys besides one small shop. The prices on AirBnB or Booking.com may seem tempting, but it's not worth it. Judging by the amount of german licence plates I have seen it's really just a vacation town
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
If you think of staying in this area go to <em>Cala Santani</em>. It is right beside Llombards and is a lot livelier and has a few DWS spots.
